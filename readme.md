# Sublime Text 3 plugin for my daily logs

This is a little plugin which adds some new commands to the Tools menu, that help create and update the markdown/yaml files I use for daily logging. Quite possibly only useful for me.

## Installation

Copy the Diary folder into the Sublime Text Packages folder (Preferences -> Browse Packages).
